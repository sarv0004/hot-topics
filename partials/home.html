      <p>Source: https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/value-of-money-628283<br>It is very rarely that we know the true value of money, otherwise most of us believe that money is everything. In many parts of our country, people are struggling for water. The parched land awaits a single drop of water. The crops have dried up and the cattle are dying because of no water. Many of People in such areas have money but their money cannot buy water. If money is so big and great that it should have bought water at any cost ! Nature has proved that money is not the biggest and the most powerful thing. There are still bigger things than money too. When there is no water the rich and the poor wait in the same queue for the water tankers. At this point of time money looses it sheen. It is then that one realizes the true value of money. We will not die without money, but we will certainly die without water. Why should a natural calamity  teach us which is more important , money or nature. The unfortunate part is that our memories have become very short. We do not want to learn despite so many calamities. The  simple lesson is: Preserve Nature........................- ..!</p>

    <h2> The view of world in 2100</h2>

      <p>Source:https://nypost.com/2017/09/20/an-apocalyptic-mass-extinction-will-begin-in-2100-scientists-say/<br>A mass extinction that wipes out humanity will be under way by the year 2100, scientists have claimed. By the end of the century, it’s feared that so much carbon will have been added to the oceans that the planet will have passed a “threshold of catastrophe” which leads to the destruction of our species. In the past 540 million years, the planet has endured five such wipeouts — including the extinction of the dinosaurs. The worst took place 252 million years ago and is known as the Great Dying. This disaster killed off more than 95 percent of marine life when the seas suddenly became more acidic. Now geophysicist Professor Daniel Rothman says we are seeing a disturbing parallel today — this time because of man-made global warming. He came up with a simple mathematical formula that predicts that the oceans will soon hold so much carbon that a mass extinction is inevitable. It showed the critical extra amount required is about 310 gigatons — which is the best-case scenario projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And it’s well below the worst of more than 500 gigatons — which would far exceed the line. In all scenarios, the study found that by the end of the century, the carbon cycle will either be close to or well beyond the threshold for catastrophe.
      Although mass extinction won’t soon follow at the turn of the century, the world may have tipped into “unknown territory.” Rothman, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says it would take some time — about 10,000 years — for such ecological disasters to play out.
      He said: “This is not saying disaster occurs the next day.
      “It’s saying — if left unchecked — the carbon cycle would move into a realm which would be no longer stable and would behave in a way that would be difficult to predict.
      “In the past this type of behavior is associated with mass extinction.”
      In the modern era, CO2 emissions have risen steadily since the 19th century, but deciphering whether this could lead to mass extinction has been challenging.
      Humans have emitted 1,540 billion tons of CO2 since the Industrial Revolution — equivalent to burning enough coal to form a square tower 72 feet wide stretching 240,000 miles from Earth to the moon.
      Half of these have remained in the atmosphere, causing a rise in levels at least 10 times faster than any known natural increase during Earth’s long history.
      Most of the other half has dissolved into the ocean — causing acidification.
      Will this lead to the destruction of humanity?
      Your grandchildren will probably find out, unless something changes now.</p>
